# How to install all dependencies for the application

## **First Method: Install Dependencies Individually** 

### **Install Python 3:**

- Download Python from the official website: python.org.
- During installation, ensure you check the box "Add Python to PATH".
- Verify the installation with: python --version

### **Verify if Pip is installed:**

- Pip usually comes pre-installed with Python. Verify with: pip --version
- If not installed, follow the pip installation guide.

### **Create and activate the virtual environment:**

- Virtual environments allow you to isolate Python projects, create with:
  ```bash
  - python -m venv DesiredVirtualEnvironmentName
  ```
- Activate with: 
  - **Windows**:
    ```bash
    .\DesiredVirtualEnvironmentName\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - **macOS/Linux**:
    ```bash
    source DesiredVirtualEnvironmentName/bin/activate
    ```
### **Install Django**

- pip install django
- Verify with: python -m django --version

### **Install Pillow**

- Pillow is required for image processing in Django install with: pip install pillow
- Verify Pillow installation with: python -m PIL

### **Run Django Server**

- First you need to make migrations of all changes with: python manage.py makemigrations
- Apply those migrations: python manage.py migrate
- Run server: python manage.py runserver
- Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

Done! You’ve successfully installed Python, Django, and Pillow, and can now use our application.

## **Second Method: Install All Dependencies at once from requirements.txt**

### **Create the virtual environment:**

- python -m venv DesiredVirtualEnvironmentName

### **Ensure you’re in your virtual environment created before:**

- **Windows**: .\DesiredVirtualEnvironmentName\Scripts\activate
- **macOS/Linux**: source DesiredVirtualEnvironmentName/bin/activate

### **Install all dependencies:**

- Run this command to install all dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- After installed all dependencies make django migrations with python manage.py makemigrations
- Migrate all the changes with python manage.py migrate
- Run django server with python manage.py runserver
- Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

# Possible issues:

If you receive an error like:

```
Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using '"<PATH>\venv\Scripts\python.exe"  "<PATH>\venv\Scripts\pip.exe" freeze': The system cannot find the file specified.
```

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

## Step 1: Edit `activate` and `activate.bat` Files

- Navigate to your virtual environment folder:
   ```
   <YOUR_PROJECT_PATH>\venv\Scripts
   ```
![Scripts Path](./readme-images/activate-img.png)

- Open the `activate` and `activate.bat` files with a text editor.
- Look for any references to the old virtual environment path (`<OLD_PATH>\venv`) and update them to the new path:
   ```
   <NEW_PATH>\venv
   ```
   -- Activate file:
  
![Scripts Path](./readme-images/activate-file-img.png)

   -- Activate.bat file:
   
![Scripts Path](./readme-images/activate-bat-file-img.png)
   
- Save the changes.

## Step 2: Restart Your Editor

- Close and reopen your code editor (e.g., VSCode) to ensure the changes are applied properly.

## Step 3: Upgrade `pip`

- Reactivate your virtual environment:
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
- Upgrade `pip` to ensure it's working correctly:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
   
## Step 4: Retry Your Command

- Try running the command again:
  ```
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

## Step 5: Recreate the Virtual Environment (If Needed)

If the issue persists, create a new virtual environment:

- Create a new virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv NewVenv
   ```
- Activate the new virtual environment:
   ```
   .\NewVenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
- Reinstall your dependencies using `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

# Fixing Virtual Environment issues

If you encounter an error such as ![Path error](./readme-images/error-path.png) after activating the virtual environment and trying to run the server, follow these steps to fix it:

1. **Locate Python installations:**
   - On **Windows**, open CMD as Administrator and type:
     ```
     where python
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**, open the terminal and type:
     ```
     which python3
     ```
     This will display all Python installations on your computer.  
     
     ![Where Python](./readme-images/where-python.png)

2. **Choose the correct Python version:**
   - Select the first path from the list. The others are not valid.
   - To verify the version on **Windows**, type:
     ```
     python --version
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**, open the terminal and type:
     ```
     python3 --version
     ```
     ![Python Version](./readme-images/python-version.png)

3. **Edit `pyvenv.cfg`:**
   - Open your virtual environment folder in your IDE and locate the `pyvenv.cfg` file.
     
     ![Open pyvenv.cfg](./readme-images/pyvenvcfg.png)

4. **Update `pyvenv.cfg` file:**
   - Modify the following keys (if necessary):
     - `version`
     - `home`
     - `executable`
     - `command`  
  
     ![Edit pyvenv.cfg](./readme-images/change-paths.png)

5. **Adjust the `command` paths:**
   - For the `command` line:
     - Replace the **first path** (highlighted in blue) with the Python path you obtained from the `where python` command.
     - Replace the **second path** with your virtual environment folder path (the same folder where you opened the `pyvenv.cfg` file).  
     
     ![Command Paths](./readme-images/command-path.png)

6. **Save and try again:**
   - Press `CTRL + S` to save the changes.
   - Re-run the server to verify that the issue is resolved.

# Resolve script execution error on Windows

If you encounter a script execution error in Windows PowerShell  while trying to activate a virtual environment (like the image below), follow these steps:

![Script Error](./readme-images/script-error.png)

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator

 - Press Win + S and type PowerShell.
 - Right-click on the PowerShell icon and select Run as Administrator.

2. Change the Execution Policy

## Run the following command to allow execution of scripts created locally while blocking unsigned remote scripts:
  ```
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```
 - When prompted, type A (Yes to All) to confirm.

3. Activate the Virtual Environment

 - Close the Administrator PowerShell.
 - Open a normal PowerShell window in your project directory.
 - Run the command to activate the virtual environment:
 ```
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
4. Optional: Revert Execution Policy After Use

To enhance security, you may revert the execution policy to its default setting:
  ```
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted
  ```
# **Important Warning**

## **If the above steps don't work, you can temporarily use a less restrictive execution policy. However, this approach allows any script to run, which can pose a security risk. Use it only if absolutely necessary:**

 - Open PowerShell as Administrator.
 - Run the command:
  ```
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
  ```
 - When prompted, type A (Yes to All) to confirm.
  
- **After completing your tasks, immediately revert to a more secure policy (e.g., RemoteSigned or Restricted).**

---

## Note:

Replace `<OLD_PATH>` with the previous incorrect path and `<NEW_PATH>` with the current correct path for your virtual environment.

- If you need help finding the path to the file or folder, just right click on the name and then copy or just right click and press SHIFT + ALT + C
